## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found any kind of security vulnerability, do **NOT**:

Instead, please send an email to <d.catovic9@gmail.com> to report this issue privately.

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and keep you informed of our progress. If needed, we may ask for:

- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Additional technical details

Once we submit a patch, we may ask you to privately test if this vulnerability can still be reproduced on your end. Once we can confirm that this vulnerability has been patched, it can be made public.

You may choose whether or not you'd like to be credited for your discovery. At this time, we do **not** offer monetary bounties.
